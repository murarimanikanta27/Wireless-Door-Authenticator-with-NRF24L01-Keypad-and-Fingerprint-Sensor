# Wireless Door Authenticator with NRF24L01, Keypad, and Fingerprint Sensor

## Overview

This project involves building a wireless door authentication system using NRF24L01 modules for communication. The system uses a keypad and fingerprint sensor at the transmitter to authenticate users. Upon successful authentication, a signal is sent wirelessly to the receiver, which triggers a servo motor to unlock the door. The system is powered by an Arduino Uno at both the transmitter and receiver, with a battery at the transmitter and a 12V power supply at the receiver.

## Features

- **Wireless Communication**: Uses NRF24L01 modules to send authentication signals from the transmitter to the receiver.
- **Dual Authentication**: Combines a keypad and fingerprint sensor for enhanced security.
- **Remote Door Unlocking**: A servo motor at the receiver unlocks the door upon successful authentication.
- **Arduino-Based**: Both the transmitter and receiver are controlled by Arduino Uno, making the system easy to program and modify.
- **Battery-Powered Transmitter**: The transmitter is powered by a battery, allowing for flexible installation.

## Components

### Transmitter

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller that processes inputs from the keypad and fingerprint sensor.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Handles wireless communication with the receiver.
- **Keypad**: Allows users to enter a PIN code for authentication.
- **Fingerprint Sensor**: Provides biometric authentication.
- **Battery Pack**: Powers the transmitter setup.

### Receiver

- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller that receives the authentication signal and controls the servo motor.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Receives wireless data from the transmitter.
- **Servo Motor**: Unlocks the door when activated.
- **12V Power Supply**: Powers the Arduino and servo motor.
- **Relay Module (optional)**: Controls the power to the servo motor if needed.

## Wiring Diagram

### Transmitter

1. **Keypad**:
   - Connect the row and column pins to digital pins on the Arduino (e.g., D2-D9).
   
2. **Fingerprint Sensor**:
   - VCC to 5V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - TX to digital pin (e.g., D10)
   - RX to digital pin (e.g., D11)

3. **NRF24L01 Module**:
   - VCC to 3.3V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - CE to digital pin 9
   - CSN to digital pin 10
   - SCK to digital pin 13
   - MOSI to digital pin 11
   - MISO to digital pin 12

4. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect the battery pack to the VCC and GND pins on the Arduino.

### Receiver

1. **NRF24L01 Module**: Same wiring as the transmitter.

2. **Servo Motor**:
   - Connect the control wire to a PWM digital pin (e.g., D3) on the Arduino.
   - Connect the power wires to the 12V power supply through a step-down converter (if needed) or a relay module.

3. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect the 12V power supply to the Arduinoâ€™s VIN and GND pins.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wireless-door-authenticator.git
   cd wireless-door-authenticator
   ```

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the `transmitter.ino` file for the transmitter setup.
   - Open the `receiver.ino` file for the receiver setup.
   - Connect each Arduino to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Click Upload to flash the code to each Arduino.

3. **Assemble the System**:
   - Mount the transmitter components near the door, connecting the keypad and fingerprint sensor.
   - Install the receiver components on or near the door, ensuring the servo motor is properly aligned with the door lock mechanism.
   - Double-check all wiring connections according to the diagrams.

4. **Power On**:
   - Insert batteries into the transmitter and connect the 12V power supply to the receiver.
   - The system should now be ready to authenticate users and unlock the door upon successful authentication.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: The user enters a PIN on the keypad and scans their fingerprint. The Arduino processes these inputs and checks for successful authentication.
2. **Signal Transmission**: If the authentication is successful, the transmitter sends a signal via the NRF24L01 module to the receiver.
3. **Door Unlocking**: The receiver activates the servo motor, which moves to unlock the door. The door remains unlocked for a set duration or until manually locked again.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Response from Door**: Check the power supply and ensure the NRF24L01 modules are correctly wired and within range.
- **Authentication Fails**: Verify the connections of the keypad and fingerprint sensor. Ensure the fingerprint data is correctly enrolled and stored.
- **Servo Motor Not Moving**: Check the servo motor connections and ensure it is receiving power. If using a relay, make sure it is functioning properly.
